<h1>EDGE Teacher Guide: Interpreting Model Output</h1>
<p>This short guide explains how to act on the EDGE model's predicted probability of misconception (<code>p</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>p ≥ 0.70</strong>: Very likely misconception. Show targeted remediation now (worked examples, step-by-step).</li>
<li><strong>0.40 ≤ p &lt; 0.70</strong>: Possible risk. Schedule practice within 24 hours (spaced repetition).</li>
<li><strong>p &lt; 0.40</strong>: Likely ready for challenge. Offer a harder problem or move forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust thresholds based on teacher preference: lower thresholds increase recall (catch more struggling students), higher thresholds increase precision (fewer false alarms).</p>
